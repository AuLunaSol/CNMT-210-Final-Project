					<h2>Who is this?</h2>
					<h3>The One Behind It All</h3>
						<hr>
					<p>
						Ying Vang is currently a fifth-year college student who aspires in expressing
						the connection between creativity and productivity by exploring the links held
						between educational disciplines and practical real-life experiences.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Growing up, he has picked up an early interest in art and has tried a hand at
						learning to draw before picking up music as an interest starting with the piano.
						Taking advantage of being able to utilize an affinity in art as well as an affinity
						in music, he has further stepped forward in a simple life goal: to make his own video
						games.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						The task of trying to create his own video games led him to a new world and found
						himself wrapped up in comprehending a new sort of logic he'd never learned before but
						had always seemed to be toying around with from his childhood.  While unsuccessful at
						making his games sustainable for the market, his experience in actually creating the
						games further led him to consider refining his affinities further.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Beginning in college, he took upon the task of becoming a triple-major student to 
						focus on developing his art further, to learn and study music for the first time,
						and to learn and study programming in the real work force.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Today, Ying Vang is a college student at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point
						and is currently a Computer Information Sciences major and also a Philosophy minor
						student. His goal to express his creativity and productivity continues to live on
						in the form of using his education as a tool to harness and refine his methods and
						goals.
