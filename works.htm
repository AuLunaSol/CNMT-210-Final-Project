					<h2>CNMT-210 Homework 2 - Form Assignment</h2>
					<h3>December 13, 2016</h3>
						<hr>
					<p>
						With the end of the semester coming around, we had just one more project left. <br />
						This assignment was tasked with creating a form that will take in data and also validate it.
						Given, I didn't do very well on this assignment, but it was nice to learn that JavaScript wasn't
						actually all that foriegn.

					<h2>CNMT-210 Homework 1 - Personal Website</h2>
					<h3>October 18, 2016</h3>
						<hr>
					<p>
						At the beginning of the semester, we were tasked with using HTML and CSS to create a personal website.
						I figured to make something less serious and something that wasn't meant to make it in the marketplace
						and thus I had this project created. This was my first actual exposure to CSS whereas in the past I've
						always used HTML with its deprecated tags. Following this, I can appreciate and understand HTML5 at last.
